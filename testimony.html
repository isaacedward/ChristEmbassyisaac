  <p>Marlos from Limpopo in South Africa was an educator in a primary school for kids. One day, on a trip to Mpumalanga, an excursion planned for the school children, he had an encounter that changed his life and destiny. The tour began a scale of events that led him to meet Jesus Christ and to experience a touch of his anointing.


                   The tour of Mpumalanga was exciting and uneventful; nothing out of the ordinary and nothing seemingly was amiss. The driver steadily approached Sudwala Caves, the final stop on the tour of Mpumalanga. Then he discovered that all was not right with the bus.

                     “Immediately we were approaching Sudwala cave, the driver of the bus began to complain that it seems as if the bus is not braking anymore.”

            Two hundred metres to Sudwala cave and approaching a T junction, the driver lost control of the bus, swinging the bus and all its occupants to the left and to the right. There were trees on their path and every swing of the bus was braced by its impact with the trees. It was a roller coaster in there and Marlos, seated in the front seat was thrown headlong to hit his head against a tree that had taken off the roof of the bus. It was a terrible accident. He suffered a deep cut to his head, injuries to his right hand, a broken knee and broken ribs. The cut was so deep and severe that he fell unconscious and was admitted in the hospital for treatment. He was there for three months. And whilst there, he was rehabilitated to allow his broken knee time to heal.

            “Though I could go to work at the time, I was still having those bandages around my head on my shoulder even on my knee and also, I had pains in the broken ribs. That was the situation that I had to face. And throughout that time, I was struggling with a severe headache and I could not concentrate at work. It was so bad that it really affected my performance at work”

            Marlos struggled afterwards in this condition. He suffered severe headaches and was constantly under medication for the pains to subside. One day he sat at home watching television and switching through the channels, he saw the program Atmosphere for Miracles with Pastor Chris’ where he heard about an upcoming crusade- the Night of Bliss with Pastor Chris. From that Atmosphere for Miracles program, Marlos determined in his heart to attend the meeting with the man of God the next time it held in South Africa.

            At the Night of Bliss in South Africa, the moment of transformation came for him when the man of God, Pastor Chris read the scripture in John chapter 1 verse 6, which says: There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. In that program, the man of God Pastor Chris declared “There was a man sent from God; his name is Pastor Chris!”. Marlos took this revelation seriously; he believed the words of the man of God and from then on, miraculous changes began to occur in his physical body!

            “So immediately he spoke that word, that he Pastor Chris was the man sent from God, I said, Wow! This is my night! I opened my heart. In that moment, I felt something had come right out of my head. It was like a thunderstorm that went off and as it did, the whole body began to shiver and it was as if somebody was putting fire in front of me because I was burning all over the body”

            Following that experience, Marlos found that he could move his body in ways that he could not do before. “I could not pick anything and it was painful. I felt strength. I said wow! I couldn’t do this before but now if I lift my hand up, I can lift it up. So, I did it once again. I said no, I'm not dreaming this is real!” He went on to remove the bandages around him, from his body and from his head. He stretched his body and tried out his legs. He was then convinced that he was totally healed. The pains were completely gone!

            “I can walk ever since 2011 till date. When you look, you can see I've gained weight everything is superb now, I can turn my head. It’s awesome!”

            What an awesome testimony! God’s healing power and anointing transcends every physical medium to touch anyone who reaches out to him in faith. Your testimony can be next, just you believe for miracle today! .</p>
